### About Me

My name is Manolis Huerta-Stylianou!  

I am a rising senior majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Mathematics and Artificial Intelligence at the Cornell University College of Engineering.

I have been interested in computer science and its applications to multidisciplinary fields of study since my early years of high school when I spent two years involved in bioinformatics research at Regeneron Pharmaceuticals. Since then, I have found a passion for research in the field of computer science, for which I am lucky and grateful for the Hunter R. Rawlings III Cornell Presidential Research Scholars (RCPRS) program and Louis Stokes Alliances for MINORITY Participation (LSAMP) program. 

As a research scholar, I have dedicated my college career insofar to demonstrating my passion for applying ML & CV methods to make progress at the frontiers of various cross-disciplinary fields. On campus at Cornell University and over summer '24 at University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, I have largely involved myself in research projects in digital agriculture â€“ a rapidly developing field of research at the crossroads of traditional robotics and biotechnology. At the CAIR lab over my freshman and sophomore years, I explored the application of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) to the 3D reconstruction of crops, and at CDA over this summer, I took my passion for research so far to a full-time scale by implementing a novel method for efficiently and effectively segmenting crop images using Vector-Quantized Variational Auto-Encoders (VQ-VAEs). This summer, I will apply my work thus far in a brand new perspective, more to come soon!

Outside of my involvement in the application of AI & robotics, I have taken a great interest in the mathematical side of Computer Science over my undergraduate years here at Cornell. Outside of my pure mathematics externalization and minor, I have embarked in two teaching positions to reach a full level of mastery in physics and mathematics, being in the courses of Electromagnetism (PHYS2213) and Computational Math (CS2800). I am also currently attending seminars in Quantum Computing and CS Theory to deepen my understanding of these fields outside of classes. As I have many passions, I am very eager to devote the time necessary to take these interests to the next level.
